# Introduction
- DNA *de novo assembly* can be used to reconstruct longer stretches of DNA (contigs), including genes and even genomes, from short DNA sequencing reads. 
- However, compared to modern samples, ancient samples are often burdened with environmental contamination, resulting in mixtures of ancient and modern DNA. 
- Distinguishing between ancient and modern sequences is particularly important for ancient microbiome studies. 
- Characteristic patterns of ancient DNA damage, namely DNA fragmentation and cytosine deamination (observed as C-to-T transitions) are typically used to authenticate ancient samples and sequences. 
- Existing tools for inspecting and filtering aDNA damage do not scale the thousands of reference generated by *de novo* assembly. 

We introduce [**PyDamage**](https://github.com/maxibor/pydamage), an automated approach for aDNA damage estimation and authentication of de novo assembled aDNA.  
It uses a likelihood ratio based approach to discriminate between truly ancient contigs and contigs originating from modern contamination.   
We tested PyDamage on both simulated, and empirical aDNA data from archaeological paleofeces.  
We demonstrated its ability to reliably and automatically identify contigs bearing DNA damage characteristic of aDNA.

# Methods
- PyDamage takes an alignment file as input (`SAM`,`BAM`,`CRAM`)
- Counting of C to T transitions is done thanks to [PySam](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)
- At each position of the reads, the damage is modelled with a binomial distribution distribution $B(n,p)$ (figure 1)  
    - the parameter $n$ is the number of *C* sites at each position
    - the parameter $p$ is estimated at each position by fitting two models to observed CtoT transitions data, with least square optimization.  
        - a null model (no damage), that assumes a uniform rate of rate of C to T substitutions (figure 1, green line)  
        - a damage model, that assumes a decreasing rate of C to T substitutions (figure 2, red line)

# Results
## Simulated data

We tested PyDamage on simulated data, varying the coverage, GC content, amount of damage, reference length, and read length (figure 2).

**Figure 2**: Simulation scheme for evaluating the performance of PyDamage. **a** The GC content of the three microbial reference genomes.
**b** The read length distributions used as input into gargammel *fragSim*. 
**c** The amount of aDNA damage as observed as the frequency of C-to-T substitutions on the terminal 5' end of the DNA fragments that was added using gargammel *deamSim*.
**d** Nine coverage bins from which the exact coverage was sampled by randomly drawing a number from the uniform distribution defining the bin. **e** Nine contig length bins from which the exact contig length was sampled by randomly drawing a number from the uniform distribution defining the bin.


After different Generalized Linear Model (GLM), 
and selecting the best performing model using balanced accuracy and Nagelkerke‚Äôs $R^2$, 
we found that **only coverage, amount of damage, and reference length** greatly affected the performance of PyDamage.  

Thanks to this GML model, we were also able to provide the user with an estimation of how accurate a PyDamage prediction can be (figure 3).

**Figure 3**: PyDamage predicted model accuracy of simulated data, in function of coverage, reference length, and amount of damage. Light blue indicates improved model accuracy,

## Archeological data

Finally, we applied PyDamage on the ZSM028 samples (previously published in [Borry et al. 2020](https://peerj.com/articles/9001/)) 
assembled with [metaSPAdes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411777/).  
The assembly yielded a total of  359,807 contigs, with an N50 of 429 bp. 
Such assemblies, consisting of a large number of relatively short contigs, are typical for *de novo* assembled aDNA datasets ([Wibowo et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03532-0))
Out of the 17,103 contigs longer than 1000bp, PyDamage estimated the damage for 99.75% of them (17,061 contigs).  

After filtering resulting contigs with enough coverage for significant pvalues, 
1944 contigs were statistically identified by PyDamage as carrying C to T deamination damage, with a mean 5' damage of 14.3% (figure 4).

def conclusion():
    conclusion = """
# Conclusion

We demonstrated that PyDamage has highly reliable damage prediction accuracy for sequences with high coverage, long lengths, and high damage, 
but the tool‚Äôs power to assess damage is reduced for lower coverage, shorter contigs length, and lower deamination levels.   
While this might at first seem like an issue, in practice, in *de novo* assembly, no contig below ~6X coverage can be assembled, and shorter contigs  are usually discarded by the end user.  

aDNA damage levels (cytosine deamination and fragmentation) are features of the DNA itself and out of the researcher‚Äôs control, but researchers can improve assembly and model accuracy through deeper sequencing.  
As the fields of microbiology and evolutionary biology increasingly turn to the archaeological records to investigate the rich and dynamic evolutionary history of ancient microbial communities, 
it has become vital to develop tools for assembling and authenticating ancient metagenomic DNA.   
**Coupled with aDNA de novoassembly, PyDamage opens up new doors to explore and understand the functional diversity of ancient metagenomes.**
